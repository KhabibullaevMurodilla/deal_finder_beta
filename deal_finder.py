"""
Anywhere Deal Finder
---------------------
Pulls live flight prices from the Travelpayouts Data API, keeps a running
history of prices per route, and uses an anomaly-detection model
(Isolation Forest) to flag which current prices are genuinely unusual
"great deals" versus just normal day-to-day price variation.

HOW TO USE:
1. Get your Data API token: log into Travelpayouts -> Tools -> API
   (this is different from your affiliate marker/link - it's a separate
   token specifically for pulling price data)
2. Paste your token into API_TOKEN below
3. Run this script (locally, or in a free Google Colab notebook)
4. It saves:
   - price_history.csv   (grows every time you run it - this is what
                           lets the model learn what "normal" looks like)
   - todays_deals.json    (the ranked list of flagged deals)
   - telegram_post.txt    (a ready-to-paste post for your channel)

Run this daily (or every few days) - the more history it builds up,
the smarter the deal detection gets over time.
